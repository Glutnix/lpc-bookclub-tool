When he is gone his neighbors drop by to &ldquo;help themselves&rdquo; to the garden produce. Can Mr. Cabbagehead succeed with his garden dreams and finally win the blue ribbon - all the while keeping his tiresome neighbors away?<br/><br/>In Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden, you will be placing vegetable cards in a grid of six cards by three cards, this being your garden plot. Of the 18 possible positions you will, by the end of the game, have at most 15 cards placed. The game is played in three phases:<br/><br/>1. The &ldquo;Mr. Cabbagehead plants vegetables in the garden while his neighbors peer over the fence at him and make tedious and tiresome comments.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Deal the top three cards of the vegetable deck face up in front of you in a row. The leftmost card costs 1 Bee to plant (place one of the Bee tokens from your supply on the Beehive. If you do not have any Bees, you may not choose this card). The center card does not cost any Bees and is free to plant. The rightmost card can be planted for free as well, and as a bonus, you may take one of the Bees from the Beehive and add it to your supply (If Bees are not available on the Beehive you may not choose this card).<br/><br/>When planting the card you may place it anywhere in your garden plot. You may remove a card already in the plot and plant the new card in that position.<br/><br/>Cards may not otherwise be moved once planted. The grid of garden plot cards does not have fixed borders until the 6th card in a row is placed and/or the 3rd card in a column.<br/><br/>Of the two remaining drawn cards, locate the card with the highest Neighbor number. Draw a number of Tedious Neighbor tokens from the token area equal to the Tedious number on this card and place the drawn token(s) on the matching Tedious Neighbor card. Then place these two remaining cards off to one side. They will not be used again.<br/><br/>Repeat this phase until 15 cards have been drawn, 5 have been planted, and the On Vacation card is showing on top of the vegetable deck. Remove the On Vacation card and go to Phase 2.<br/><br/>2. The &ldquo;Oh those vegetables look ripe! Be a shame to let the birds get them while Mr. Cabbagehead is on holiday. Maybe I should just pop over and grab a few for myself.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Whichever Tedious Neighbor card has the most tokens on it will determine which neighbor takes a vegetable card from the garden plot. The removed vegetable is placed off to once side and not used again, and all Tedious Neighbor tokens are shuffled back into the supply with their On Vacation side facing up.<br/><br/>The 1st and 2nd Phase will alternate until all 45 vegetable cards have been dealt and 15 cards have been planted (If you or your neighbors have removed cards during Phases 1 and 2 there may be fewer than 15 cards in your garden plot at this point).<br/><br/>3. The &ldquo;Ms. Eudora Brassica and the Garden Club arrive to judge Mr. Cabbagehead&rsquo;s garden for the annual Blue Ribbon Garden Contest.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Scoring of the garden plot now takes place. Vegetables only score if they are orthogonally adjacent to other matching vegetable cards. No single vegetables score any points.<br/><br/>For each vegetable type, the score equals: the point value x number of adjacent matching cards<br/><br/>For each vegetable you have removed from the garden plot subtract 2 points. Score each set of adjacent vegetables and then apply any Awards of Merit as shown on the back of Eudora&rsquo;s card, adding them to your total.<br/><br/>You may score one or more awards if your garden plot matches the specific award requirements.<br/><br/>"],"thumbnail":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2865219_t.jpg"],"image":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2865219.jpg"],"boardgamepodcastepisode":[{"_":"1P 099 - Project Dreamscape","$":{"objectid":"177297"}},{"_":"If You Buy One Game - Relaxing Games","$":{"objectid":"179475"}},{"_":"What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 77!","$":{"objectid":"182153"}}],"boardgamepublisher":[{"_":"Air and Nothingness Press","$":{"objectid":"23816"}},{"_":"LudiCreations","$":{"objectid":"24881"}}],"boardgamemechanic":[{"_":"Card Drafting","$":{"objectid":"2041"}},{"_":"Pattern Recognition","$":{"objectid":"2060"}},{"_":"Set Collection","$":{"objectid":"2004"}}],"boardgamecategory":[{"_":"Card Game","$":{"objectid":"1002"}},{"_":"Farming","$":{"objectid":"1013"}},{"_":"Print & Play","$":{"objectid":"1120"}},{"_":"Puzzle","$":{"objectid":"1028"}}],"boardgameversion":[{"_":"English edition 2017","$":{"objectid":"322528"}},{"_":"English first edition","$":{"objectid":"298290"}}],"boardgamedesigner":[{"_":"Todd Sanders","$":{"objectid":"42166"}}],"boardgameartist":[{"_":"Todd Sanders","$":{"objectid":"42166"}}],"poll":[{"$":{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"1"},"results":[{"$":{"numplayers":"1"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]},{"$":{"numplayers":"1+"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"1"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"level":"11","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"level":"12","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"13","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"14","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"15","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"0"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"10","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"12","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}}]}]}]},"thumbedby":["Celinashope","FairGwen","Glutnix","Keoki98","Kierkegaard555","LuluChia","Matharos","Naomiooooo8","Nerdsbeware","RainRaven","coojd2004","dumarest123","ellabean","kazozza","kelann08","ljtrigirl","neko_cam","njonet","pschorf","thevig","vintersphrost"],"thumbsweighted":22},"body":["This seems bizarre, and I want to play it.\n\n[q]Each year Vernon Cabbagehead, Mr. Cabbagehead to his friends (who will be played by you), wants to be left in peace to grow his award winning vegetable garden for the annual Garden Club contest, but his tedious neighbors bother him so much that he needs to go on holiday to the beach several times during the summer months just to get away from them.

You have a break at work? You&rsquo;re riding on a train? All you need is a bit of space and you can start your adventure and put your opponents to the sword! The whole game has a humorous graphic design and its style resembles a two-dimension platform games known from computers or mobile games.<br/> Manage your dices by assigning them to right adventures. Choose from available actions on the field. But remember, you need to plan a few steps ahead! Arrange food so that you can rest, because if you don&rsquo;t your hero will bite the dust sooner than you think! Also, remember about your hero&rsquo;s special skills because they might save you more than once!<br/><br/>"],"thumbnail":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3594312_t.jpg"],"image":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3594312.jpg"],"boardgamepublisher":[{"_":"(Web published)","$":{"objectid":"1001"}},{"_":"Thistroy Games","$":{"objectid":"36458"}}],"boardgamecategory":[{"_":"Adventure","$":{"objectid":"1022"}},{"_":"Fantasy","$":{"objectid":"1010"}},{"_":"Print & Play","$":{"objectid":"1120"}}],"boardgamemechanic":[{"_":"Dice Rolling","$":{"objectid":"2072"}},{"_":"Point to Point Movement","$":{"objectid":"2078"}}],"boardgamedesigner":[{"_":"Michał Jagodziński","$":{"objectid":"74794"}},{"_":"Paweł Niziołek","$":{"objectid":"93734"}},{"_":"Jarosław Wajs","$":{"objectid":"74795"}}],"boardgameartist":[{"_":"Paweł Niziołek","$":{"objectid":"93734"}},{"_":"Jarosław Wajs","$":{"objectid":"74795"}}],"boardgameversion":[{"_":"Print & Play Edition","$":{"objectid":"357535"}}],"poll":[{"$":{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"0"},"results":[{"$":{"numplayers":"1"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]},{"$":{"numplayers":"1+"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"2"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"level":"21","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"2"}},{"$":{"level":"22","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"23","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"24","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"25","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"0"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"10","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"12","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}}]}]}]},"thumbedby":["Artorig","Aschenglut","Decar","Gameboy2016","Glutnix","Kezia","LuluChia","Mantheron","NiZikn","ellabean","fortheloveofdice","kazozza","kelann08","mikolajl","travisdhill","uhlik","vintersphrost"],"thumbsweighted":19},"body":["Looks like a fun and easy to build solo!"]},{"$":{"id":"5483343","objecttype":"thing","subtype":"boardgame","objectid":"228570","objectname":"Raging Bulls","username":"Glutnix","postdate":"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:25:38 +0000","editdate":"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:25:38 +0000","thumbs":"15","imageid":"3593005","gamedata":{"$":{"objectid":"228570"},"yearpublished":["2017"],"minplayers":["1"],"maxplayers":["1"],"playingtime":["30"],"minplaytime":["20"],"maxplaytime":["30"],"age":["8"],"name":[{"_":"Raging Bulls","$":{"primary":"true","sortindex":"1"}}],"description":["Whoever thought it was a good idea to put a load of bulls together in one field?<br/>Well, yours is not to reason why.

Each card shows an aggression number (ranging from 0 to 3) which represents the attacks you have received while travelling.<br/>Sum the aggression numbers  of each card you draw to get an Attack value which represents the amount of wounds you have sustained this turn.<br/>At any time, if the total attack value is higher than Frodo's wounds, the player immediately loses the game.<br/><br/>This means that the Attack value will be the sum of all aggression numbers of cards drawn this turn.<br/><br/>Example: if the player chooses directions with a high destination number, which makes him move faster, he will finish the mission within the preset time of 25 days/turns, but will also increase the chances of getting damaged and killed.<br/><br/>At any time, but before drawing cards from the quest deck, you can use the RING which will turn Frodo invisible and, therefore, immune to all the attacks received (consider all aggression numbers as 0). BUT doing so will also bring the Witch King closer to you. Any time you use the Ring, put a token on the the Witch King Track on the play mat.<br/>The first time you use the ring, put a token on the Ring symbol on the play mat: this is a reminder that the ring has been used at least once.<br/><br/>While drawing or before drawing (depending on the item), the player will have the chance to use one item he is equipped with.<br/>The player can use only one item per turn.<br/><br/>C.  Card Effects can be good or bad, depending on the card.<br/>A player resolves the card effects ONLY of the last drawn card of the turn. Unless otherwise stated, the ONLY thing the player should take into account while drawing the cards is the aggression number.<br/><br/>Example: if the player chooses a direction with a destination number 3, he draws (one at a time) 3 cards, adding the Aggression Numbers of all 3 cards and resolving ONLY the effects of the 3rd card.&quot;<br/><br/>Each turn, the player will have many choices to make, from deciding if he wants to rest (and recover his wounds), to which direction to go; from using potions or other items (like the Ring), to going looking for Aragorn to help him against the Witch King.<br/><br/>Main game mechanic: push your luck.<br/><br/>"],"thumbnail":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031629_t.png"],"image":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031629.png"],"boardgamepublisher":[{"_":"(Web published)","$":{"objectid":"1001"}}],"boardgamepodcastepisode":[{"_":"1P 034 - D-Day Dice","$":{"objectid":"96565"}},{"_":"1P 111 - LotR Adventure Deck Game + The Networks","$":{"objectid":"190626"}}],"boardgamehonor":[{"_":"2012 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee","$":{"objectid":"20125"}}],"boardgamecategory":[{"_":"Adventure","$":{"objectid":"1022"}},{"_":"Card Game","$":{"objectid":"1002"}},{"_":"Fantasy","$":{"objectid":"1010"}},{"_":"Novel-based","$":{"objectid":"1093"}},{"_":"Print & Play","$":{"objectid":"1120"}}],"boardgamemechanic":[{"_":"Card Drafting","$":{"objectid":"2041"}},{"_":"Press Your Luck","$":{"objectid":"2661"}}],"boardgamedesigner":[{"_":"Michele Esmanech","$":{"objectid":"41932"}}],"boardgameartist":[{"_":"Michele Esmanech","$":{"objectid":"41932"}}],"boardgameversion":[{"_":"First edition","$":{"objectid":"108404"}}],"boardgamefamily":[{"_":"Solitaire Games","$":{"objectid":"5666"}},{"_":"Solitaire Print and Play Contest","$":{"objectid":"19564"}},{"_":"Tolkien Games","$":{"objectid":"4263"}}],"boardgamesubdomain":[{"_":"Thematic Games","$":{"objectid":"5496"}}],"poll":[{"$":{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"4"},"results":[{"$":{"numplayers":"1"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"4"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]},{"$":{"numplayers":"1+"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"1"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"3"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"level":"41","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"42","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"43","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"2"}},{"$":{"level":"44","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"level":"45","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"3"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"6","numvotes":"2"}},{"$":{"value":"8","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"value":"10","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"12","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}}]}]}]},"thumbedby":["Gameboy2016","Glutnix","Ikim","LuluChia","ellabean","kelann08","thevig"],"thumbsweighted":8},"body":["Lord of the Rings.

This deck, and your character, will change and grow as you play more games, which is meant to reflect how tales become more embellished and outlandish each time they are told.<br/><br/>Each turn you flip over the top three cards of the adventure deck. These cards represent monsters, treasures, and the favors of the gods. You must then allocate your crew members to each of the cards. After all of your crew have their tasks, you roll against each card. The more crew members you have on a card, the likelier you are to resolve it positively. Monsters are defeated and treasures are won. Fail the roll and treasures will be lost to you, and monsters will send your crew members to Hades. As you are among the crew, once they have all died you will also be on your way to meet Charon.<br/><br/>Once the deck has been exhausted, the adventure is complete and you have won! The game is not over however. After each successful retelling of your adventures, the story grows! Much like tales become taller every time they are told, the adventure deck will become more legendary each time you win.<br/><br/>All of the cards in the game will have check boxes on them that will be used to represent the level of the card. Cards that were defeated or captured after a successful adventure will be marked: monsters will become stronger and treasures will lose durability. Some monsters will even bring reinforcements into your deck.<br/><br/>Additionally, so that the player may keep up, the player can also level up after successful adventures.

Using just a standard deck of playing cards and a record sheet, the player defends a city against a stream of attackers, trying to hold out until the deck is exhausted, at which time a score may be figured based on how well the city survived.<br/><br/>Originally created on a business flight because I wish I had something I could play on a tiny airplane tray and all I had was a deck of cards and a notebook, it has been playtested and developed further as a submission for the Solitaire Print and Play Contest in July 2011.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The record sheet divides a city into four sections, each with defenders, walls and city ratings. Each turn, the player will use hand cards to generate reinforcements, repairs, defensive sorties and other special actions based on the rank and suit of the cards he has. Afterward, the enemy troops appear based on card draws where each suit corresponds to a quadrant of the city and the rank indicates strength. However, each suit of enemy has an ability or advantage that makes them a little different from each other when attacking or appearing. The attack process is straightforward and occurs automatically each round after both the player and the enemy have played their cards.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game the player may make more informed decisions about how to spend his cards based on which cards he's already seen come out of the deck, but luck (good and bad) is still present in which cards he gets in hand to spend and where and in what order the enemies arrive. Many cards can be spent in more than one way by the player, so there is a degree of hand management as well.<br/><br/>The game is designed to play with a standard deck of cards and a record sheet, making this a very portable, small-footprint game. I've played it holding the whole deck in one hand and simply placing the discards face-up at the bottom of the deck, while making my notes and tracking information on the record sheet.<br/><br/>"],"thumbnail":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1199822_t.jpg"],"image":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1199822.jpg"],"boardgamepublisher":[{"_":"(Web published)","$":{"objectid":"1001"}}],"boardgamecategory":[{"_":"Card Game","$":{"objectid":"1002"}},{"_":"Fantasy","$":{"objectid":"1010"}},{"_":"Fighting","$":{"objectid":"1046"}},{"_":"Print & Play","$":{"objectid":"1120"}}],"boardgameversion":[{"_":"First Edition","$":{"objectid":"113476"}}],"boardgamemechanic":[{"_":"Hand Management","$":{"objectid":"2040"}}],"boardgamedesigner":[{"_":"Michael Haverty","$":{"objectid":"30118"}}],"boardgamefamily":[{"_":"Solitaire Games","$":{"objectid":"5666"}},{"_":"Solitaire Print and Play Contest","$":{"objectid":"19564"}},{"_":"Traditional Card Games","$":{"objectid":"98"}}],"poll":[{"$":{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"2"},"results":[{"$":{"numplayers":"1"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"2"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]},{"$":{"numplayers":"1+"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"1"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"level":"51","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"52","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"53","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"level":"54","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"55","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"0"}}]},"thumbedby":["Gameboy2016","Glutnix","Mantheron","kelann08"],"thumbsweighted":5},"body":["A simple tower defense game where you use a standard deck of cards."]},{"$":{"id":"5484454","objecttype":"thing","subtype":"boardgame","objectid":"199081","objectname":"JellyBeanstalk","username":"sarebear62","postdate":"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 10:17:19 +0000","editdate":"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 10:19:22 +0000","thumbs":"3","imageid":"3014994","gamedata":{"$":{"objectid":"199081"},"yearpublished":["2016"],"minplayers":["1"],"maxplayers":["4"],"playingtime":["15"],"minplaytime":["5"],"maxplaytime":["15"],"age":["8"],"name":[{"_":"JellyBeanstalk","$":{"primary":"true","sortindex":"1"}}],"description":["Together players grow the JellyBeanstalk and help Jack climb it, collecting their favourite flavour of Jelly Bean along the way.

Society in this distant time is divided into four powerful guilds. These are the Energy Guild (symbolized by a red sun), the Synthesis Guild (symbolized by a blue fountain), the Control Guild (the most powerful guild of all, symbolized by a green crown), and the Builder's Guild (symbolized by a black tool---yes, that's how tools look in the far future).<br/><br/>Cities in this future contain two types of structures, towers and domes. Towers are owned by the various guilds. These are the power plants (energy), factories (synthesis), and government facilities (control). Domes are smaller structures used to house the citizens. As with the towers, domes are always associated with a particular guild. Both towers and domes are color-coded to identify guild affiliation; red for energy, blue for synthesis, green for control, and black for builders.<br/><br/>Each of the guilds wants its towers positioned close to the towers and domes of other guilds (their customers) and far away from its own other towers (to avoid competing with other towers of their own guild). Location, location, location! Some things never change, even in the distant future.<br/><br/>The Builder's Guild is unique because there are no Builder's Guild towers, i.e., no black towers. Instead, the Builders are compensated for their efforts by being given the profits of some of the other guilds&rsquo; towers that the Builders choose as they construct the city.<br/><br/>The players in this game are competing builders working to construct the city. At the same time, they are choosing towers for themselves that they hope will be profitable with many close customers and little competition. The choices must be made with care because each builder may only choose three.<br/><br/>Red, blue, and green large Icehouse Pieces are used for the towers, and piecepack coins with the suit side up represent red, blue, green, and black domes. The land area of the city is defined by a 4x5 array of piecepack tiles, suit side up, with each tile representing four building sites. The game-play consists of the players alternating turns, placing a tower or dome each turn until either all<br/>available towers and domes have been placed or until there are no legal construction sites remaining within the city.

When he is gone his neighbors drop by to &ldquo;help themselves&rdquo; to the garden produce. Can Mr. Cabbagehead succeed with his garden dreams and finally win the blue ribbon - all the while keeping his tiresome neighbors away?<br/><br/>In Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden, you will be placing vegetable cards in a grid of six cards by three cards, this being your garden plot. Of the 18 possible positions you will, by the end of the game, have at most 15 cards placed. The game is played in three phases:<br/><br/>1. The &ldquo;Mr. Cabbagehead plants vegetables in the garden while his neighbors peer over the fence at him and make tedious and tiresome comments.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Deal the top three cards of the vegetable deck face up in front of you in a row. The leftmost card costs 1 Bee to plant (place one of the Bee tokens from your supply on the Beehive. If you do not have any Bees, you may not choose this card). The center card does not cost any Bees and is free to plant. The rightmost card can be planted for free as well, and as a bonus, you may take one of the Bees from the Beehive and add it to your supply (If Bees are not available on the Beehive you may not choose this card).<br/><br/>When planting the card you may place it anywhere in your garden plot. You may remove a card already in the plot and plant the new card in that position.<br/><br/>Cards may not otherwise be moved once planted. The grid of garden plot cards does not have fixed borders until the 6th card in a row is placed and/or the 3rd card in a column.<br/><br/>Of the two remaining drawn cards, locate the card with the highest Neighbor number. Draw a number of Tedious Neighbor tokens from the token area equal to the Tedious number on this card and place the drawn token(s) on the matching Tedious Neighbor card. Then place these two remaining cards off to one side. They will not be used again.<br/><br/>Repeat this phase until 15 cards have been drawn, 5 have been planted, and the On Vacation card is showing on top of the vegetable deck. Remove the On Vacation card and go to Phase 2.<br/><br/>2. The &ldquo;Oh those vegetables look ripe! Be a shame to let the birds get them while Mr. Cabbagehead is on holiday. Maybe I should just pop over and grab a few for myself.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Whichever Tedious Neighbor card has the most tokens on it will determine which neighbor takes a vegetable card from the garden plot. The removed vegetable is placed off to once side and not used again, and all Tedious Neighbor tokens are shuffled back into the supply with their On Vacation side facing up.<br/><br/>The 1st and 2nd Phase will alternate until all 45 vegetable cards have been dealt and 15 cards have been planted (If you or your neighbors have removed cards during Phases 1 and 2 there may be fewer than 15 cards in your garden plot at this point).<br/><br/>3. The &ldquo;Ms. Eudora Brassica and the Garden Club arrive to judge Mr. Cabbagehead&rsquo;s garden for the annual Blue Ribbon Garden Contest.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Scoring of the garden plot now takes place. Vegetables only score if they are orthogonally adjacent to other matching vegetable cards. No single vegetables score any points.<br/><br/>For each vegetable type, the score equals: the point value x number of adjacent matching cards<br/><br/>For each vegetable you have removed from the garden plot subtract 2 points. Score each set of adjacent vegetables and then apply any Awards of Merit as shown on the back of Eudora&rsquo;s card, adding them to your total.<br/><br/>You may score one or more awards if your garden plot matches the specific award requirements.<br/><br/>"],"thumbnail":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2865219_t.jpg"],"image":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2865219.jpg"],"boardgamepodcastepisode":[{"_":"1P 099 - Project Dreamscape","$":{"objectid":"177297"}},{"_":"If You Buy One Game - Relaxing Games","$":{"objectid":"179475"}},{"_":"What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 77!","$":{"objectid":"182153"}}],"boardgamepublisher":[{"_":"Air and Nothingness Press","$":{"objectid":"23816"}},{"_":"LudiCreations","$":{"objectid":"24881"}}],"boardgamemechanic":[{"_":"Card Drafting","$":{"objectid":"2041"}},{"_":"Pattern Recognition","$":{"objectid":"2060"}},{"_":"Set Collection","$":{"objectid":"2004"}}],"boardgamecategory":[{"_":"Card Game","$":{"objectid":"1002"}},{"_":"Farming","$":{"objectid":"1013"}},{"_":"Print & Play","$":{"objectid":"1120"}},{"_":"Puzzle","$":{"objectid":"1028"}}],"boardgameversion":[{"_":"English edition 2017","$":{"objectid":"322528"}},{"_":"English first edition","$":{"objectid":"298290"}}],"boardgamedesigner":[{"_":"Todd Sanders","$":{"objectid":"42166"}}],"boardgameartist":[{"_":"Todd Sanders","$":{"objectid":"42166"}}],"poll":[{"$":{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":"1"},"results":[{"$":{"numplayers":"1"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]},{"$":{"numplayers":"1+"},"result":[{"$":{"value":"Best","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":"1"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"level":"11","value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":"1"}},{"$":{"level":"12","value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"13","value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"14","value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"level":"15","value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":"0"}}]}]},{"$":{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":"0"},"results":[{"result":[{"$":{"value":"2","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"3","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"4","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"5","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"6","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"8","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"10","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"12","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"14","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"16","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"18","numvotes":"0"}},{"$":{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":"0"}}]}]}]},"thumbedby":["Celinashope","FairGwen","Glutnix","Keoki98","Kierkegaard555","LuluChia","Matharos","Naomiooooo8","Nerdsbeware","RainRaven","coojd2004","dumarest123","ellabean","kazozza","kelann08","ljtrigirl","neko_cam","njonet","pschorf","thevig","vintersphrost"],"thumbsweighted":22},"body":["This seems bizarre, and I want to play it.\n\n[q]Each year Vernon Cabbagehead, Mr. Cabbagehead to his friends (who will be played by you), wants to be left in peace to grow his award winning vegetable garden for the annual Garden Club contest, but his tedious neighbors bother him so much that he needs to go on holiday to the beach several times during the summer months just to get away from them.
